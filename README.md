# Talks
Community driven talk proposals and discussions for Node.js Houston.

## Goal

Talks given at Node.js Houston are encouraged to be given by developers who attend the event. We are wanting to make sure everyone has a say in what they want to learn and teach. If there is a talk you would like to see or talk you want to give just create an issue. Anyone can give feedback and we want to be fully open. Only positive and constructive feedback. We are people after all. ðŸ˜ƒ
